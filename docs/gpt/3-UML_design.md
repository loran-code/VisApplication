This is the url https://github.com/loran-code/VisaApplication/tree/2-system_design

I am now at the part where I want to create UML diagrams to get a better overview of how the software architecture is supposed to be created.

The high overview for the project is that a user can log in to a web application and apply for a visa for crossing the borders of Montenegro/Kosovo/Albania.

The user is able to create an account. Submit a form for applying for a visa. the user should be informed throughout the process. when the visa has successfully been submitted. when the visa has been processed and the result of the visa application should be send to the users mail address/account.

Let's start by creating a class diagram.

___

A:

Let's start crafting the class diagram for the VisApplication project. Given the detailed requirements and software architecture you've described, the diagram will include several key components such as user management, visa application processing, payment handling, and notification systems. I'll include important classes along with their attributes and methods that define the relationships and responsibilities in the context of the application.

Here's an overview of the classes we might consider:

1. **User**: Manages user information and authentication.
2. **VisaApplication**: Represents a visa application form submitted by a user.
3. **Payment**: Handles payment transactions.
4. **NotificationService**: Manages sending notifications to users.
5. **ApplicationService**: Core service handling the business logic of application processing.
6. **AuthenticationService**: Manages user login and security.
7. **VisaApplicationController**: The API controller that handles HTTP requests related to visa applications.
8. **UserRepository**: Interface to the user data.
9. **VisaApplicationRepository**: Interface to the visa application data.
10. **PaymentService**: Interface to payment gateway integration.

Below is the PlantUML code that represents the class diagram for these components:

```plantuml
@startuml
class User {
    +String email
    +String passwordHash
    +DateTime lastLogin
    +authenticate(): boolean
    +register(): User
    +resetPassword(): boolean
}

class VisaApplication {
    +UUID id
    +String applicantEmail
    +String travelCountry
    +Date travelDate
    +String status
    +submitApplication(): boolean
    +validateDetails(): boolean
}

class Payment {
    +UUID id
    +Decimal amount
    +String currency
    +String status
    +processPayment(): boolean
}

class NotificationService {
    +sendEmailNotification(): void
    +sendSMSNotification(): void
}

class ApplicationService {
    +reviewApplication(): boolean
    +approveApplication(): void
    +rejectApplication(): void
}

class AuthenticationService {
    +login(): boolean
    +logout(): void
    +validateToken(): boolean
}

class VisaApplicationController {
    +createApplication(): void
    +updateApplication(): void
    +deleteApplication(): void
}

class UserRepository {
    +findUserById(): User
    +findAllUsers(): List<User>
    +updateUser(): boolean
}

class VisaApplicationRepository {
    +findApplicationById(): VisaApplication
    +findAllApplications(): List<VisaApplication>
    +updateApplication(): boolean
}

class PaymentService {
    +initiatePayment(): Payment
    +verifyPayment(): boolean
}

User --> AuthenticationService: Uses
VisaApplicationController --> ApplicationService: Uses
ApplicationService --> VisaApplicationRepository: Uses
ApplicationService --> UserRepository: Uses
ApplicationService --> PaymentService: Uses
ApplicationService --> NotificationService: Uses

Q:

Continue with the component diagram

---

A:

Let's proceed with designing a component diagram for the VisApplication project. This diagram will focus on illustrating the different components of your application, their interactions, and how they are organized within the overall system architecture, aligned with the Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design principles you're employing.

Here's an outline of the main components that we can include in your diagram:

1. **Web Interface (UI)**: The front-end part of the application where users interact.
2. **Controllers**: Manages user requests, orchestrating user input and application responses.
3. **Application Services**: Serves as the coordination layer handling business logic.
4. **Domain Model**: Encapsulates the core business logic and rules.
5. **Repository Interfaces**: Provides an abstraction layer for data access.
6. **Infrastructure Services**: Supports the system with technical capabilities like logging, caching, and external API communications.
7. **Database**: Stores user and application data persistently.
8. **External Services**: Such as payment gateways and email services.

Here's the PlantUML code you can use:

```plantuml
@startuml
package "VisApplication" {
    [Web Interface] as UI
    [Controllers]
    [Application Services]
    [Domain Model]
    [Repository Interfaces]
    [Infrastructure Services]
    [External Services]
    database "Database" {
        [Data Store]
    }
}

UI --> Controllers : user input
Controllers --> [Application Services] : invokes
[Application Services] --> [Domain Model] : uses
[Domain Model] --> [Repository Interfaces] : data manipulation
[Repository Interfaces] --> [Data Store] : read/write
[Application Services] --> [Infrastructure Services] : utilizes
[Infrastructure Services] --> [External Services] : integrates
[External Services] --> [Database]
@enduml
```

You can paste this code into any PlantUML editor to generate the diagram. If you need help with any other aspect of your design or further UML diagrams, please let me know!

---

Q:

Continue with the Object Diagram

---

A:

Let's create an object diagram for a specific scenario within the VisApplication project. Object diagrams are useful for illustrating examples of data structures at a particular moment in time, based on the class models. For VisApplication, I'll focus on a typical use case of a user applying for a visa, including instances of user authentication, visa application submission, payment processing, and notification sending.

Here's a description of the scenario:

1. **User** logs into the system.
2. **User** submits a visa application.
3. **Payment** is processed.
4. **Notification** is sent upon successful submission and payment.

### Objects and Their Links:

- **User Object**: Represents the logged-in user.
- **VisaApplication Object**: Represents the application submitted by the user.
- **Payment Object**: Represents the payment transaction for the visa application fee.
- **Notification Object**: Represents the notification sent to the user about the status of their application.

Here's the PlantUML code to visualize this scenario:

```plantuml
@startuml
object User {
    email = "john.doe@example.com"
    passwordHash = "hashedpassword123"
}

object VisaApplication {
    id = "VA123456789"
    applicantEmail = "john.doe@example.com"
    travelCountry = "Montenegro"
    travelDate = "2024-06-15"
    status = "Submitted"
}

object Payment {
    id = "PAY987654321"
    amount = 50.00
    currency = "EUR"
    status = "Confirmed"
}

object Notification {
    type = "Email"
    recipient = "john.doe@example.com"
    message = "Your visa application has been submitted and payment is confirmed."
}

User -> VisaApplication : applies
VisaApplication -> Payment : triggers
Payment -> Notification : results in
@enduml
```

This diagram shows the objects involved in the visa application process and how they are interrelated.

Q:

Continue with a Profile Diagram

---

A:

Creating a UML Profile Diagram involves defining stereotypes, tagged values, and constraints that tailor UML to specific domains or platforms. Profile diagrams are especially useful for adapting UML to particular purposes, extending the UML language to cover specific needs. In the context of your VisApplication project, we can define a UML profile to accommodate certain aspects specific to the application domain, such as specific security, performance, or regulatory requirements.

Let’s consider some potential stereotypes and tagged values that might be relevant for the VisApplication system, particularly focusing on areas like security and compliance which are critical for a visa application system.

### Stereotypes:
- **<<Secure>>**: Could be applied to components or operations that require special security considerations (e.g., user authentication, payment processing).
- **<<GDPRCompliant>>**: Applied to components or classes that handle personal data, ensuring they adhere to GDPR guidelines.
- **<<Asynchronous>>**: Used for services or operations that are performed asynchronously, like sending notifications or processing payments.

### Tagged Values:
- **concurrencyLevel**: An attribute that can be attached to components to specify how many concurrent users they are expected to support.
- **encryptionLevel**: Specifies the level of encryption required for storing or transmitting data.

### Example Profile Diagram:
We'll create a simple profile diagram to illustrate how you might define these stereotypes and tagged values within the context of your application:

```plantuml
@startuml

' Define stereotypes
stereotype Secure
stereotype GDPRCompliant
stereotype Asynchronous

' Apply stereotypes to classes with tagged values
class UserData {
    +String name
    +String passportNumber
}
UserData : <<GDPRCompliant>>

class PaymentProcessor {
    +processPayment() : boolean
}
PaymentProcessor : <<Secure>>
PaymentProcessor : encryptionLevel = "AES-256"

class NotificationService {
    +sendEmailAsync() : void
}
NotificationService : <<Asynchronous>>

@enduml
```

This profile diagram defines the stereotypes and shows how they might be applied to specific classes in your application.

By tailoring a UML profile to the specific needs of your project, you can make your UML diagrams more expressive and relevant to stakeholders, and ensure that your design documentation directly supports your architectural decisions. If you need further details on how to apply this profile or how to adapt it for other aspects of your application, feel free to ask!

---

Q:

Continue with Composite Structure Diagram

---

A:

Creating a Composite Structure Diagram for the VisApplication project will help illustrate the internal structure and interaction of parts within a component or a set of components. This type of diagram is useful for detailing the runtime collaborations between parts that collectively achieve the system's functionality, particularly in a complex system like an online visa application platform.

### Scenario Overview

For VisApplication, let's consider the component that handles the visa application process. This component will involve sub-components like user authentication, visa application form handling, payment processing, and notification dispatching. Each of these parts plays a role in handling a visa application, and they interact with one another to complete the process.

### Composite Structure Diagram Elements

- **VisaApplicationComponent**: The main component that orchestrates the visa application process.
   - **UserAuthentication**: Responsible for user identification and security.
   - **ApplicationFormHandler**: Manages the intake and validation of application forms.
   - **PaymentProcessor**: Handles payment transactions.
   - **NotificationManager**: Sends out notifications related to application status.

### PlantUML Code

Here's the PlantUML code that represents the composite structure for this scenario:

```plantuml
@startuml
package "Visa Application System" {
    component VisaApplicationComponent {
        component UserAuthentication {
            port inPort1
            port outPort2
        }
        component ApplicationFormHandler {
            port inPort2
            port outPort3
        }
        component PaymentProcessor {
            port inPort3
            port outPort4
        }
        component NotificationManager {
            port inPort4
        }

        UserAuthentication -down-> ApplicationFormHandler : user data transfer
        ApplicationFormHandler -down-> PaymentProcessor : form approval
        PaymentProcessor -down-> NotificationManager : payment confirmation
    }
}
@enduml
```

This diagram will help you visualize the internal structure of the VisaApplicationComponent and how its parts interact to manage the visa application process.

If you need further details or adjustments to the diagram, please let me know!

---

Q:

Create a Use Case Diagram

---

A:

For the VisApplication project, creating a Use Case Diagram will help visually represent the interactions between various types of users and the system itself, focusing on the functional requirements you've outlined. Let's detail the primary use cases for the users interacting with your visa application system.

### Actors:
1. **Applicant**: A user applying for a visa.
2. **External Entity**: The office in the destination country that reviews the visa applications.

### Use Cases:
- **Register Account**: Allows an applicant to create a user account.
- **Log In**: Enables applicants to authenticate into the system.
- **Submit Visa Application**: Applicants can fill out and submit their visa applications.
- **Pay Application Fee**: Applicants handle the payment of visa application fees.
- **Track Application Status**: Applicants can view the current status of their applications.
- **Receive Notifications**: Applicants receive updates about their application status from the system.
- **Review Visa Application**: The external entity reviews submitted visa applications.
- **Send Review Results**: The external entity sends the results back to the VisaApplication app.

### PlantUML Code for the Updated Use Case Diagram:
Here is the revised PlantUML code to visualize these use cases and actor interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
left to right direction
actor Applicant
actor "External Entity"

usecase "Register Account" as UC1
usecase "Log In" as UC2
usecase "Submit Visa Application" as UC3
usecase "Pay Application Fee" as UC4
usecase "Track Application Status" as UC5
usecase "Receive Notifications" as UC6
usecase "Review Visa Application" as UC7
usecase "Send Review Results" as UC8

Applicant --> UC1
Applicant --> UC2
Applicant --> UC3
Applicant --> UC4
Applicant --> UC5
Applicant --> UC6

"External Entity" --> UC7
"External Entity" --> UC8

@enduml
```

This diagram includes the external entity and their role in the visa application process, showing a clear separation between the applicant's interactions with the VisApplication system and the external entity's responsibilities.

If you have any more adjustments or need further assistance, let me know!

---

Q:

Continue with the activity diagram

---

A:

To create an Activity Diagram for the VisApplication project, we'll focus on the process of a user applying for a visa. This will include activities from the moment a user decides to apply for a visa to when they receive the decision on their application. The diagram will capture sequential and conditional activities, showing the flow from one activity to another.

### Scenario Overview:
1. **User Registration**: The user creates an account.
2. **User Login**: The user logs into their account.
3. **Fill Out Visa Application Form**: The user enters required information.
4. **Submit Visa Application**: The application is submitted to the system.
5. **Process Payment**: Payment for the visa application fee is processed.
6. **Application Review by External Entity**: The external entity reviews the application.
7. **Receive and Notify Decision**: The system receives the decision and notifies the user.

### PlantUML Code for the Activity Diagram:
Here's the PlantUML code to visualize the activity flow in the visa application process:

```plantuml
@startuml
start

:User Registration;
:User Login;
note right: User must be logged in to apply
:Fill Out Visa Application Form;
:Submit Visa Application;
:Process Payment;
if (Payment Successful?) then (yes)
  :Application Sent to External Entity;
else (no)
  :Display Payment Error;
  stop
endif

:Application Review by External Entity;
note right: Review could take variable time
if (Application Approved?) then (yes)
  :Notify User of Approval;
else (no)
  :Notify User of Denial;
endif

stop

@enduml
```

This diagram will help you visualize the user's journey through the visa application process within your application, including decision points such as the success of the payment and the outcome of the external review.

This activity diagram is designed to provide a clear overview of the visa application process, highlighting key activities and decisions. If you need additional details or modifications to better fit your project needs, please let me know!

---

Q:

Continue with State Machine Diagram.

---

A:

To design a State Machine Diagram for the VisApplication project, we can focus on the lifecycle of a visa application within your system. This diagram will illustrate the various states that a visa application can go through from initiation to conclusion, including transitions based on events and conditions.

### States of a Visa Application:
1. **Created**: The initial state after a user fills out and submits the visa application form.
2. **Submitted**: The state after the application is officially submitted and awaiting payment processing.
3. **Payment Processed**: Occurs when the payment is successfully processed.
4. **Under Review**: The application has been sent to the external entity for review.
5. **Approved**: The application is approved by the external entity.
6. **Denied**: The application is denied by the external entity.
7. **Cancelled**: The user cancels the application before it is reviewed.

### Events and Transitions:
- **Submit Application**: Transitions from Created to Submitted.
- **Complete Payment**: Transitions from Submitted to Payment Processed.
- **Forward to Review**: Transitions from Payment Processed to Under Review.
- **Review Complete**: Depending on the outcome, transitions to either Approved or Denied.
- **Cancel Application**: Can transition from Created, Submitted, or Payment Processed to Cancelled.

### PlantUML Code for the State Machine Diagram:
Here is the PlantUML code to create a State Machine Diagram representing the lifecycle of a visa application:

```plantuml
@startuml
[*] --> Created: Start
Created --> Submitted: Submit Application
Submitted --> PaymentProcessed: Complete Payment
PaymentProcessed --> UnderReview: Forward to Review
UnderReview --> Approved: Review Complete (Approved)
UnderReview --> Denied: Review Complete (Denied)
Approved --> NotificationSent: Update and Notify User
Denied --> NotificationSent: Update and Notify User
NotificationSent --> [*]
@enduml
```

This diagram visualizes the transitions between the different states of a visa application, guided by user actions and system events.

If you need adjustments to this diagram or additional diagrams to further illustrate other parts of your system, feel free to ask!

---

Q:

Continue with a Sequence Diagram

---

A:

For the VisApplication project, let's create a Sequence Diagram that outlines the sequence of interactions between objects for the use case where a user submits a visa application and the system processes it up to the point where the external entity sends back the review results.

### Scenario Steps:
1. **User** initiates the visa application submission process.
2. **System** prompts for user authentication.
3. **User** authenticates.
4. **System** provides the visa application form.
5. **User** submits the completed form and payment information.
6. **PaymentService** processes the payment.
7. **VisaApplicationService** sends the application to the external entity.
8. **External Entity** reviews the application.
9. **VisaApplicationService** receives the review results.
10. **NotificationService** informs the user of the decision.

### PlantUML Code for the Sequence Diagram:
Here's the PlantUML code to visualize the sequence of interactions based on the steps mentioned:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant "System" as Sys
participant "AuthenticationService" as Auth
participant "VisaApplicationService" as AppSvc
participant "PaymentService" as Payment
participant "External Entity" as Entity
participant "NotificationService" as Notify

User -> Sys: Start Application
Sys -> Auth: Prompt for Authentication
User -> Auth: Authenticate
Auth -> Sys: Authentication Success
Sys -> User: Provide Visa Application Form
User -> Sys: Submit Application Form and Payment
Sys -> Payment: Process Payment
Payment --> Sys: Payment Confirmation
Sys -> AppSvc: Send Application to External Entity
AppSvc -> Entity: Review Application
Entity -> AppSvc: Application Approved/Denied
AppSvc -> Notify: Send Notification to User
Notify -> User: Notify of Decision
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram captures the interactions and flow of control from the user submitting a visa application to receiving the review decision notification.

If you need the diagram to reflect a different sequence or additional steps, let me know so I can adjust it accordingly!

---

Q:

Continue with Communication Diagram

---

A:

A Communication Diagram in UML illustrates the interactions between objects or parts of a system that collaborate to achieve a specific goal, focusing on the relationships and message flow within the system. For the VisApplication project, the communication diagram will depict the interactions for the visa application process similarly to the sequence diagram but will focus on the connections and message flow between the objects.

### Scenario Overview:
The same steps from the sequence diagram apply here:
1. User authenticates and submits the visa application.
2. The system processes the payment.
3. The visa application is sent to the external entity.
4. The application review result is received.
5. The user is notified of the decision.

### PlantUML Code for the Communication Diagram:
Here's the PlantUML code to represent the communication between the system's components during the visa application process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User as U
participant "System" as Sys
participant "AuthenticationService" as Auth
participant "PaymentService" as Pay
participant "VisaApplicationService" as AppSvc
participant "External Entity" as Ext
participant "NotificationService" as Notify

U -> Sys : 1: Start Application
Sys -> Auth : 2: Authenticate
Auth -> U : 3: Authentication Success
U -> Sys : 4: Submit Application & Payment
Sys -> Pay : 5: Process Payment
Pay -> Sys : 6: Confirm Payment
Sys -> AppSvc : 7: Send Application
AppSvc -> Ext : 8: Review Application
Ext -> AppSvc : 9: Application Approved/Denied
AppSvc -> Notify : 10: Send Decision Notification
Notify -> U : 11: Notify User of Decision
@enduml
```

Each numbered message corresponds to a step in the process. This diagram emphasizes the interactions and the objects that communicate with each other, giving a clear view of the message flow for the process.

Adjustments can be made to the diagram if there are more details about the interactions that need to be captured or if there are additional steps or objects involved. Let me know if you have specific requirements or if there's anything else you'd like to add!

Q:

Create a Deployment diagram

---

A:

A Deployment Diagram in UML models the physical deployment of artifacts on nodes. For the VisApplication project, the deployment diagram can show the setup of your servers, the various services running on them, and how they might be connected.

### Deployment Diagram Elements:
1. **Web Server**: Hosts the web application interface.
2. **Application Server**: Runs the application logic (e.g., Blazor Server for frontend, .NET Core backend).
3. **Database Server**: Hosts the PostgreSQL database.
4. **External Services**: Represents third-party services like payment gateway, email service.
5. **Client Devices**: Users' devices connecting to the application.

### PlantUML Code for the Deployment Diagram:
Here's the PlantUML code that represents the deployment of the VisApplication:

```plantuml
@startuml
package "Client Devices" {
  [User's Device] 
}

node "Web Server" {
  artifact "Web UI" as UI
}

node "Application Server" {
  artifact "VisApplication Backend" as Backend
  artifact "Blazor Server App" as Blazor
}

node "Database Server" {
  database "PostgreSQL" as DB
}

[User's Device] --> UI : uses
UI --> Blazor : delivers
Blazor --> Backend : communicates
Backend --> DB : reads/writes

cloud "External Services" {
  [Payment Gateway] 
  [Email Service] 
}

Backend --> [Payment Gateway] : integrates
Backend --> [Email Service] : integrates
@enduml
```

In this diagram:
- **Client Devices** represent the user's entry point into the system.
- **Web Server** serves the web UI, typically hosted on platforms like IIS, Nginx, or Apache.
- **Application Server** contains your backend logic and Blazor server application.
- **Database Server** holds the data persistently.
- **External Services** are third-party systems that provide payment and email functionalities.

This code is for a basic setup. The diagram should illustrate the physical deployment of the application components and how they interact.

If your deployment has more components or you need a more detailed diagram, let me know the specifics, and I can expand the diagram accordingly!

Q:

Create a Interaction Overview Diagram

---

A:

An Interaction Overview Diagram in UML is a type of activity diagram in which nodes are interactions or interaction uses. It shows a high-level view of the control flow between various interaction diagrams (like sequence, communication, timing, etc.) that detail the system's operations. For VisApplication, we can outline the interaction overview of a user submitting a visa application and the system's subsequent actions to process this application.

### Interaction Overview Diagram Elements:
1. **Start**: The initiation of the visa application process.
2. **Authenticate User**: A sequence or communication diagram detailing user authentication.
3. **Submit Application**: A sequence or communication diagram detailing visa application submission.
4. **Process Payment**: A sequence or communication diagram for payment processing.
5. **Application Review**: A sequence or communication diagram for the external entity reviewing the application.
6. **Notify User**: A sequence or communication diagram for notifying the user of the decision.
7. **End**: The conclusion of the visa application process.

### PlantUML Code for the Interaction Overview Diagram:
Here's the PlantUML code representing the interaction overview for the visa application process:

```plantuml
@startuml
(*) --> "Authenticate User"
--> "Submit Application"
if "Payment Successful?" then
  --> [yes] "Process Payment"
  --> "Application Review"
  if "Application Approved?" then
    --> [yes] "Notify User (Approved)"
    -right-> (*)
  else
    --> [no] "Notify User (Denied)"
    -left-> (*)
  endif
else
  --> [no] "End Process (Payment Failed)"
  --> (*)
endif
@enduml
```

In this diagram:
- Each named rectangle ("Authenticate User", "Submit Application", etc.) can represent an entire sequence or communication diagram that would detail that part of the process.
- Decision points ("Payment Successful?", "Application Approved?") lead to different flows based on the outcome of those points.

The PlantUML code creates a high-level overview showing the control flow, with forks in the process depending on conditions encountered during the application and review stages.

Interaction Overview Diagrams can get complex quickly as they reference other detailed diagrams, but they are excellent for providing a 'map' of the overall interaction flow in a system. If you need to drill down into more details or add more interactions, just let me know the specifics!

Q:

> I've decided to copy paste the complete chat back into a fresh GPT conversation asking the following question

This is a readme on my UML design chat with GPT. Would you add/change anything?

A:

Your UML diagrams and their detailed descriptions cover a comprehensive view of the VisApplication project, providing a solid foundation for understanding and documenting the system architecture and behavior. Here are a few suggestions to enhance or extend your current UML documentation:

1. **Integration Details**:
    - For **sequence diagrams** and **communication diagrams**, consider detailing the interaction with external services more thoroughly, such as how the application handles API failures, retries, or fallbacks when interacting with payment gateways or email services.
    - You might also want to illustrate how the application handles asynchronous operations, especially with external services that don't respond immediately.

2. **Security Aspects**:
    - Adding more details about security processes in the **sequence** and **state machine diagrams** could be beneficial. For instance, showing how authentication tokens are refreshed or how security checks are performed before sensitive actions are executed.

3. **Error Handling**:
    - Introduce **activity diagrams** or **state machine diagrams** that focus on error handling and recovery processes. This could include how the system handles form validation errors, payment failures, or unexpected system faults.

4. **Scalability and Performance**:
    - For the **deployment diagram**, consider showing scaling strategies—such as load balancers, multiple application server instances, and database replication. This would be particularly useful given the non-functional requirement for handling 100 concurrent users.

5. **Mobile and Responsive Aspects**:
    - If your application supports mobile devices or needs to be responsive, including a **deployment diagram** or **component diagram** that shows mobile clients and their interactions with backend services could be useful. This might highlight different UI components or services tailored to mobile platforms.

6. **Advanced UML Features**:
    - Utilize UML **profiles** to define custom stereotypes that are specific to your domain, such as <<Cacheable>>, <<HighAvailability>>, or <<HighLoad>>. These can help in quickly identifying the components or operations that have special requirements related to performance, availability, or scalability.

7. **Comprehensive Testing Scenarios**:
    - An **interaction overview diagram** that integrates different testing scenarios could be beneficial. This diagram could outline how unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance tests interact with the various components of the system.

These enhancements can help in not only providing a deeper understanding of the system but also in addressing specific technical and business concerns that might be critical for stakeholders. If you would like to see examples of any of these suggestions or need further modifications, please let me know!
