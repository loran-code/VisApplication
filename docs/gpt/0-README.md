# GPT Folder Overview

Welcome to the `gpt` directory within the `docs` folder of the VisApplication project. This directory serves as a curated archive for the interactions and conversations I have with OpenAI's Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) during the development of the VisApplication. The purpose of documenting these dialogues is to provide transparency into the development process and showcase how GPT assists in problem-solving and learning.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Development Dialogues**: Conversations with GPT that have guided critical architectural and design decisions for the project. These may include discussions on patterns, best practices, and specific C# or .NET queries.

- **Learning Journey**: Questions asked to GPT that highlight my learning curve, helping me and potentially others understand complex concepts in software design and implementation.

- **Problem-Solving Sessions**: Troubleshooting transcripts where GPT provided insights or solutions to coding roadblocks, bugs, or conceptual hurdles.

- **Innovative Ideas**: Instances where brainstorming with GPT led to innovative features or approaches within the application.

- **Reference Queries**: Any queries made to clarify documentation, best practices, or to compare multiple approaches for implementing a feature.

## How to Navigate

Each document within this folder is named descriptively to reflect the primary focus of the conversation with GPT. The files are ordered chronologically, allowing you to follow the progression of the project and understanding as it unfolds.

## Purpose of Documentation

This documentation is not just a record but a tool. It's meant to:

- **Educate**: Provide learning material for those interested in the intersection of AI and software development.

- **Inspire**: Encourage other developers to leverage AI as a co-creator and to document their own journeys.

- **Demystify**: Offer a peek behind the curtain of the development process, showing that it's okay to seek help and that even AI-assisted development involves a learning curve.

By exploring these documents, readers can gain insights into the iterative process of building a

software application with the assistance of AI, and witness the real-time growth of a developer honing their craft. Whether you're a seasoned developer or new to the field, these pages aim to inform and inspire your own development endeavors.

Enjoy your journey through the documented interactions that have shaped VisApplication!
