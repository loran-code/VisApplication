Q:

I am creating a Visa Application repository on Github.

I will make it open source and will build it in public as i am trying to learn DDD, CA, in C#/.NET.

I've called the repo VisApplication, what kind of description can I give it?
the application that I will create is a website where people can log in and create a visa application for the balkan peaks hiking trails.

But for the description of the repository I just need a short story / 1 liner.

Where I let people know I am learning the architectures, C# and that I build in public and that I will use GPT to create the project from start to finish.

___

A:

For your GitHub repository, VisApplication, focused on creating a website for visa applications to the Balkan Peaks hiking trails, you can craft a concise description that encapsulates the essence of your project, your learning journey, and the technologies you're embracing. Here’s a suggestion:

"An open-source journey to develop a visa application portal for Balkan Peaks hikers, using C#/.NET, DDD, CA, and GPT. Built in public as I explore architecture and coding firsthand."

This description gives a clear picture of what the project is, the technologies and methodologies you're learning and applying, and your commitment to transparency in your development process.

___

Q:

what license suits this projects?

___

A:

Choosing the right license for your project depends on how you want others to use it. Since your project is open-source and intended for educational purposes, as well as collaboration, you might consider the following licenses:

1. **MIT License**: This is a permissive license that is short and to the point. It lets people do almost anything they want with your project, like making and distributing closed source versions, as long as they provide attribution back to you and don’t hold you liable. This license encourages open collaboration by minimizing the restrictions on the use of your project.

2. **Apache License 2.0**: Similar to the MIT License, the Apache License is also permissive, but it also provides an express grant of patent rights from contributors to users. It’s a good choice if you want to have a permissive license that also provides protection against patent claims.

3. **GNU General Public License (GPL) v3.0**: This is a copyleft license that requires anyone who distributes your code or a derivative work to make the source available under the same terms. GPL licenses are designed to ensure that the software remains free and open source. If you want to ensure that derivative works are also open-sourced, this is a strong choice.

Given your emphasis on learning and building in public, the **MIT License** might be the most suitable for your project. It's simple, allows for broad use and modification, and doesn't require derivative works to be open-sourced. This can encourage more people to use and contribute to your project, as it imposes fewer restrictions on how your project can be used.

However, the choice of license is ultimately yours and should reflect your goals for the project. If ensuring that all modifications remain open source is important to you, consider the **GPL v3.0**. If you want a balance between openness and protecting against patent claims, **Apache License 2.0** might be appropriate.

___

Q:

What kind of .gitignore template?

___

A:

For a C#/.NET project like your visa application portal, which also involves learning and integrating Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Clean Architecture (CA), and GPT, you'll want a .gitignore file that covers a range of common and platform-specific files to exclude. This includes binaries, build outputs, tool-specific files, and temporary files that are not necessary to include in the version control system. Here's a recommended template to start with:

This template is quite comprehensive, covering the most common exclusions for C#/.NET development environments including Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and JetBrains Rider, as well as general file types and directories that are typically not necessary to track in source control (like build outputs and user-specific settings).

```txt
# User-specific files
*.rsuser
*.suo

<<Very long example abbreviated>>

# Visual Studio Code directories
.vscode/
```

Remember, the .gitignore file can and should be customized based on your specific project needs and development environment. You might not need to exclude everything listed here, or you may need to add other files specific to tools or libraries you use.

](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/VisualStudio.gitignore)

___

Q:

I have a license and a gitignore what other setup things can I do for a new project?

___

A:

Setting up a new project, especially one focused on learning and applying architectural patterns like Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Clean Architecture (CA) in C#/.NET, involves several initial steps beyond selecting a license and configuring a `.gitignore` file. Here are key setup actions to consider for a solid project foundation:

### 1. **Repository Structure**
- **Organize your solution into projects** based on functionality and responsibility, such as Core, Infrastructure, Application, and UI. This separation aligns with DDD and CA principles.
- **Create directories** for different layers and concerns, reflecting the architectural patterns you’re learning.

### 2. **README.md**
- **Document the project’s purpose, setup, and usage instructions**. A clear README helps collaborators understand your project, how to run it, and the project's goals.
- **Outline architectural decisions**. Since you’re learning DDD and CA, briefly describe how these are applied in your project.

### 3. **Issue Templates & Contributing Guidelines**
- **Set up issue and feature request templates** in GitHub to streamline contributions and bug reporting.
- **Create CONTRIBUTING.md** with guidelines for how others can contribute to your project, including coding standards, branching strategies, and pull request processes.

### 4. **Branching Strategy**
- Decide on a branching strategy (e.g., Git Flow, GitHub Flow) to organize development, features, releases, and fixes.

### 5. **CI/CD**
- **Set up Continuous Integration (CI)** for building and testing your code automatically when pushed to your repository. GitHub Actions is a convenient option for this.
- **Plan for Continuous Deployment (CD)** if you aim to deploy regularly to a live environment. This could be as simple as automatic deployment to a testing server.

### 6. **Unit Testing**
- **Set up a testing framework** (e.g., xUnit, NUnit, MSTest) for your project. Writing tests from the start encourages TDD (Test-Driven Development) and ensures your code works as expected.
- **Include a directory for your tests** in your project structure, typically mirroring the structure of your application code.

### 7. **Dependency Management**
- **Configure NuGet packages** as needed for your project. Common initial packages might include Entity Framework for ORM, ASP.NET Core Identity for authentication, and FluentValidation for input validation.

### 8. **Security Measures**
- **Implement security best practices** from the start, including secure storage of secrets (using Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or .NET Secret Manager), applying secure coding practices, and setting up HTTPS for web applications.

### 9. **Docker Support**
- **Add Docker support** if you plan to containerize your application. This involves creating a `Dockerfile` and possibly `docker-compose.yml` for orchestrating multiple containers (e.g., your app and a database).

### 10. **Logging and Monitoring**
- **Set up logging** using a library like Serilog or NLog.
- **Consider monitoring solutions** (e.g., Application Insights, Prometheus with Grafana) to track the health and performance of your application.

### 11. **Documentation**
- Start with basic **documentation on your project’s architecture, design choices, and key flows**. This can evolve as your project grows.

### 12. **Accessibility and Internationalization**
- If your application is a web app, consider **web accessibility (a11y) and internationalization (i18n) from the start**.

Starting with these foundational elements in place will help manage the complexity as your project grows, ensure best practices, and make it easier for others to contribute and understand your project.

Q: 

Can you create a README.md for this part of the project.

Can you show me an example of the src and tests directory setup for DDD and CA.

Would I create new projects for each layer or would I just create a folder with the name that belongs to the layer e.g. domain?

___

A:

Certainly! Below, I'll provide an example `README.md` tailored to your project, followed by a suggestion for structuring your `src` and `tests` directories to align with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Clean Architecture (CA) principles. For such architectures, it's common to create separate projects for each layer to enforce separation of concerns through physical boundaries, which can also facilitate independent deployment, scaling, and testing.

# VisApplication - Visa Application Portal for Peaks of the Balkans

Welcome to VisApplication, an open-source project aimed at simplifying the visa application process for adventurers eager to explore the Peaks of the Balkans. This project is not only a tool to serve the hiking community but also a learning journey into the world of software architecture, specifically Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Clean Architecture (CA), and leveraging the capabilities of GPT and C#/.NET.

## Project Objectives
- To provide a seamless interface for users to apply for hiking visas.
- To explore and implement DDD and CA in a real-world application.
- To incorporate GPT for enhanced user interactions and processing.
- To document the learning process and decisions in a public forum.

### Project Structure Example

For a DDD and CA-based project, separating concerns into different projects within your solution is a recommended approach. Here’s an example structure:

#### Solution Structure (`src` directory)
- **VisApplication.sln** - Solution file.
  - **VisApplication.Core** (class library) - Contains domain models, interfaces, and business logic.
  - **VisApplication.Infrastructure** (class library) - Implements interfaces defined in Core, e.g., data access, file storage, external services.
  - **VisApplication.Application** (class library) - Contains application logic, uses Core and Infrastructure, orchestrates the flow of data and operations.
  - **VisApplication.Web** (web project) - The entry point of the application, an ASP.NET Core Web API or MVC project.
  - **VisApplication.SharedKernel** (optional, class library) - Shared functionalities between different layers, like exceptions, interfaces, or data types.

#### Tests Structure (`tests` directory)
- **VisApplication.UnitTests** (test project)
  - **Core** - Tests related to the Core project.
  - **Application** - Tests for application services.
- **VisApplication.IntegrationTests** (test project)
  - Tests that involve multiple layers and external integrations.

### Creating Projects for Each Layer
Creating separate projects for each layer, rather than just folders, is advantageous for several reasons:
- **Enforces separation**: It makes it physically impossible for, e.g., UI code to directly call the infrastructure or domain layer, adhering strictly to the dependency rule of Clean Architecture.
- **Independent development and deployment**: Allows layers to be versioned, developed, and potentially deployed independently.
- **Focused testing**: Makes it easier to manage and run tests targeted at specific layers of the application.

This setup emphasizes the separation of concerns, one of the core principles of Clean Architecture and DDD, by establishing clear boundaries between different responsibilities within your application.

Q:

how can I create this folder setup in Jetbrains Rider?

___

A: 

Creating the folder and project setup for a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Clean Architecture (CA) based application in JetBrains Rider is straightforward. Below are the steps to create the solution structure as discussed, including separate projects for each layer (Core, Infrastructure, Application, and Web) along with a test project.

### Step 1: Creating the Solution

1. **Open JetBrains Rider** and select **New Solution** on the startup screen.
2. Choose **Console Application** or **ASP.NET Core Web Application** (depending on your entry point preference) under the .NET category, then click **Next**.
3. Enter your **Project name** (e.g., VisApplication.Web) and **Solution name** (e.g., VisApplication). Adjust the **Location** as needed.
4. Select the **.NET version** you're targeting and click **Create**.
5. Your entry point project (Web) is now created.

### Step 2: Adding Projects for Each Layer

For each layer (Core, Infrastructure, Application), you'll add a new project to the solution:

1. **Right-click on the Solution** in the Solution Explorer panel and choose **Add | New Project**.
2. Select **Class Library** for the type of project since most of these layers will be libraries, then click **Next**.
3. Enter the **Project name** according to the layer (e.g., VisApplication.Core) and click **Create**.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for each layer/project (e.g., VisApplication.Infrastructure, VisApplication.Application).

### Step 3: Organizing Projects into Folders

While JetBrains Rider doesn't use physical folders to group projects in the solution view, you can organize projects into virtual solution folders for better organization:

1. **Right-click on the Solution** in the Solution Explorer and select **Add | New Solution Folder**.
2. Name the folder according to the grouping you want (e.g., "src" for source projects, "tests" for test projects).
3. Drag and drop your projects into the respective solution folders to organize them.

### Step 4: Adding References Between Projects

To set up dependencies (e.g., Application references Core):

1. **Right-click on the project** that needs to reference another (e.g., VisApplication.Application) and select **Add | Add Reference**.
2. In the dialog, check the project(s) you want to reference (e.g., VisApplication.Core) and click **OK**.

### Step 5: Setting Up the Test Projects

1. **Right-click on the Solution** or the "tests" solution folder and choose **Add | New Project**.
2. Choose a test project template (e.g., NUnit Test Project, xUnit Test Project) and name it according to your testing strategy (e.g., VisApplication.UnitTests).
3. **Add project references** within your test projects to the projects you intend to test.

### Step 6: Configuring `.gitignore`

1. JetBrains Rider should automatically generate a `.gitignore` file when creating the solution. If not, you can add it manually:
    - **Right-click on the Solution** in the Solution Explorer, select **Add | New File**.
    - Name the file `.gitignore` and fill it with the necessary contents as discussed earlier.

### Additional Tips

- **Use the Terminal**: JetBrains Rider includes an integrated terminal. You can use it to run dotnet CLI commands, like adding packages or running migrations.
- **Explore Rider’s Features**: JetBrains Rider offers many features to support DDD and CA, such as refactoring tools, database support, and version control integration.

By following these steps, you should have a well-organized solution structure that supports the principles of DDD and CA, ready for development in JetBrains Rider.

Q:

So I had already created a git repo and pulled it.

How can I create/add a .sln to this project/repo?
Why do you call the project VisApplication.Application instead of just Application?

___

A:

Naming the project "VisApplication.Application" instead of just "Application" is a practice often seen in solutions following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Clean Architecture (CA) principles, especially in larger or more complex systems. This naming convention is chosen for several reasons:

### 1. **Namespace Clarity**
- Using a prefix like "VisApplication" helps to ensure that the project's namespaces are unique, especially in environments where multiple projects or libraries might have similar names. It reduces the risk of naming conflicts with system or third-party libraries.

### 2. **Solution Organization**
- In a solution with multiple projects, including those that might belong to different bounded contexts or subsystems, having a descriptive prefix helps to quickly identify the project's purpose and its relation to the overall system.

### 3. **Consistency**
- Applying a consistent naming convention across all projects within the solution (e.g., VisApplication.Core, VisApplication.Infrastructure) aids in understanding the structure and purpose of each project at a glance.

### 4. **Discoverability**
- When dealing with many projects or when referencing them in other solutions, a clear and descriptive name makes it easier to find the right project without needing to delve into its internals.

### 5. **Avoiding Common Names**
- Certain names like "Application" or "Domain" are very generic and might be used by frameworks, libraries, or tools. Using a specific prefix can avoid accidental overrides or confusion.

### Practical Consideration
While this naming convention has its benefits, it's also essential to consider the context and scale of your project. For smaller projects or those with a limited scope, a simpler naming might suffice. The key is to ensure that your naming convention aids the development process and project understanding, not hinders it.

Q: 

What are the differences between a blazor web app and a blazor server app.

Which one makes the most sense for my project?

How can I choose this project type in rider?

___

A:

Blazor allows developers to build interactive web applications using C# and .NET. It comes in two hosting models: Blazor WebAssembly (WASM) and Blazor Server. Each has its strengths and considerations, affecting which one you might choose for a project like a visa application portal for the Peaks of the Balkans hiking trail.

### Blazor WebAssembly

- **Client-Side Execution**: The application runs directly in the web browser using WebAssembly. The entire app, including UI components, dependencies, and .NET runtime, are downloaded to the browser.
- **Pros**:
    - **Offline Support**: Can work offline once loaded.
    - **Client-Side Processing**: Utilizes the client's resources, reducing server load.
    - **Interactive UI**: Suited for applications requiring rapid UI interactions without server roundtrips.
- **Cons**:
    - **Initial Load Time**: Requires downloading the app and .NET runtime, which can lead to slower initial load times.
    - **SEO Challenges**: Content is rendered client-side, which can be less favorable for search engine indexing.
    - **Resource Intensive for Clients**: Especially on mobile or low-power devices.

### Blazor Server

- **Server-Side Execution**: The application runs on the server, and UI interactions are handled over a SignalR connection. Only the minimal HTML and JavaScript required to establish this connection are sent to the browser.
- **Pros**:
    - **Fast Initial Load**: The client quickly receives a minimal page while the UI is dynamically rendered server-side.
    - **Reduced Client Requirements**: Less demand on the client's resources since the processing is done server-side.
    - **Server-Side Capabilities**: Direct access to server-side resources, databases, and file systems.
- **Cons**:
    - **Latency and Scalability**: UI responsiveness can suffer from network latency. Also, the server must manage multiple client connections simultaneously, impacting scalability.
    - **Always-On Connection**: Requires a persistent connection to the server, which can be problematic in environments with unstable internet.

### Which One for Your Project?

For a visa application portal:
- **Blazor WebAssembly** might be more appealing if you expect a lot of interaction within the application without needing to frequently go back to the server. It's also a good choice if you want to provide offline capabilities or reduce the server load.
- **Blazor Server** could be better if your application requires constant server interaction, such as validating user inputs against server-stored data or if you want to minimize client-side resource requirements.

Given the nature of a visa application portal, which might involve form submissions, data validations, and perhaps dynamic content loading based on user input, **Blazor Server** could be a more straightforward choice, especially if you expect to deploy in environments with reliable server-client connections. It simplifies handling data securely and efficiently without worrying about client-side resources.

### Choosing in JetBrains Rider

To create a Blazor project in JetBrains Rider:

1. **Open Rider** and select **New Solution**.
2. In the **New Project** window, filter by "Blazor" to find Blazor templates.
3. Choose either:
    - **Blazor Server App** for a Blazor Server project.
    - **Blazor WebAssembly App** for a Blazor WebAssembly project.
4. Fill in the project details (name, location, etc.) and select the .NET version you're targeting.
5. Click **Create** to generate your new Blazor project.

Rider will set up a new solution with the necessary structure for your selected Blazor project type, including example components and configurations to get you started.

___

Q:

This is what I have now.

How can I move these in the src and tests folder?

___

A:

In JetBrains Rider, you have two ways to organize your projects into virtual folders for clarity and organization:

### Option 1: Using Solution Folders in Rider
1. Right-click on the solution (`VisApplication`) in the Solution Explorer.
2. Choose **Add | New Solution Folder**.
3. Name the new folder `src` for your source code.
4. Repeat the process to create a `tests` folder for your test projects.
5. Drag and drop your project folders (not the individual files) into the corresponding solution folders. For instance, drag `VisApplication.Application`, `VisApplication.Domain`, `VisApplication.Infrastructure`, and `VisApplication.Web` into the `src` folder.
6. Drag and drop `VisApplication.UnitTests` and `VisApplication.IntegrationTests` into the `tests` folder.

### Option 2: Manually Editing the .sln File
1. Close Rider and make sure all processes are terminated.
2. Navigate to your solution folder on your file system.
3. Open the `.sln` file with a text editor.
4. Manually group projects under the `src` and `tests` virtual folders by editing the solution file. For example:
    ```plaintext
    Project("{GUID}") = "src", "src", "{GUID}"
    EndProject
    Project("{GUID}") = "VisApplication.Application", "src\VisApplication.Application\VisApplication.Application.csproj", "{GUID}"
    EndProject
    Project("{GUID}") = "VisApplication.Domain", "src\VisApplication.Domain\VisApplication.Domain.csproj", "{GUID}"
    EndProject
    Project("{GUID}") = "VisApplication.Infrastructure", "src\VisApplication.Infrastructure\VisApplication.Infrastructure.csproj", "{GUID}"
    EndProject
    Project("{GUID}") = "VisApplication.Web", "src\VisApplication.Web\VisApplication.Web.csproj", "{GUID}"
    EndProject
    Project("{GUID}") = "tests", "tests", "{GUID}"
    EndProject
    Project("{GUID}") = "VisApplication.UnitTests", "tests\VisApplication.UnitTests\VisApplication.UnitTests.csproj", "{GUID}"
    EndProject
    Project("{GUID}") = "VisApplication.IntegrationTests", "tests\VisApplication.IntegrationTests\VisApplication.IntegrationTests.csproj", "{GUID}"
    EndProject
    ```
5. Save the `.sln` file and reopen the solution in Rider. Your projects should now appear within the `src` and `tests` virtual folders.

### Important Note:
- The above manual steps are for illustrative purposes. The GUIDs and exact format will depend on your actual solution file. Be careful when editing the `.sln` file, as incorrect changes can corrupt the solution.
- Virtual solution folders in Rider (and Visual Studio) are a way to visually organize projects in the IDE. They do not change the actual file system structure.

After organizing your projects into these virtual solution folders, the structure will remain the same on the file system, but they will be displayed in an organized manner within Rider's Solution Explorer.

___

Q:

User
What about the when I push it to git.

Are the solution src and tests folders also pushed?

shouldn't I add the .sln file to git?

___

A:

When you organize your projects into solution folders in JetBrains Rider or any other IDE, these folders are virtual and only exist within the context of the solution file (.sln). They don't have a corresponding physical folder on your file system, but the organization will be reflected in the solution file itself, which is why it's important to commit and push the `.sln` file to your Git repository.

Here's what you should do:

1. **Commit the .sln File**: Yes, you should definitely add and commit the `.sln` file to your Git repository if you haven't already. The solution file contains the structure of your solution, including any virtual folders (like `src` and `tests`) and project references. It's vital for anyone cloning the repository to understand the solution organization and for IDEs to load it correctly.

2. **Committing the Structure**: Since the `src` and `tests` are virtual folders within the solution, they won't appear as physical folders in your Git repository. However, the organization you've created will be represented in the solution file, and when other developers clone the repository and open the solution in their IDE, they will see the same organization.

3. **Push to Git**: After you've organized your projects in Rider and made sure the `.sln` file is updated, commit the changes. Then, push the commit to your remote Git repository.

Here's a basic rundown of the commands to add the solution file and commit your changes if you haven't done so already:

```bash
git add VisApplication.sln
git commit -m "Add solution file with organized projects"
git push origin main  # Assuming 'main' is your default branch
```

If you have any other untracked files or changes, you will need to add and commit those as well. The `.gitignore` file that you have set up will ensure that only the necessary files (source code, solution files, project files, etc.) are tracked and any build artifacts or user-specific settings are ignored.

Remember, the key takeaway is that the solution folders organize how projects are displayed in your development environment, but they don't change the physical directory structure on your file system. The `.sln` file, which reflects this organization, should be part of your Git repository so that anyone cloning the project will have the same structure in their IDE.

___

Q:

so i shouldn't use "real" folders to put the projects in?

___

A:

In the context of a .NET solution, using "real" (physical) folders for organizing your projects can be beneficial for a number of reasons:

1. **Clarity**: Having a clear physical structure on disk that mirrors your solution organization can make it easier for developers to navigate the codebase, especially outside of the IDE.

2. **Source Control**: It helps in source control management by visually grouping related projects when browsing the repository in a web interface or command line, not just in the IDE.

3. **Build and Deployment**: It can simplify build and deployment scripts, which might rely on directory paths to find and process projects.

Here's an example structure using physical folders:

```
VisApplication/
│
├── .git/
├── .gitignore
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── VisApplication.sln
│
├── src/
│   ├── VisApplication.Application/
│   ├── VisApplication.Domain/
│   ├── VisApplication.Infrastructure/
│   └── VisApplication.Web/
│
└── tests/
    ├── VisApplication.UnitTests/
    └── VisApplication.IntegrationTests/
```

In this setup, `src` and `tests` are actual directories on your file system. You would place each project within its respective directory. The solution file (.sln) would reference the projects in their directories.

Here's how you can organize your projects into physical folders:

1. **Create the Physical Folders**: In your file system, create `src` and `tests` folders within your main repository folder.

2. **Move the Project Folders**: Cut and paste your project folders (`VisApplication.Application`, `VisApplication.Domain`, etc.) into the `src` folder. Do the same for the test projects and the `tests` folder.

3. **Update the Solution File**: After moving the projects, open your solution in Rider. It will likely indicate that the projects are missing because their locations have changed. Remove the missing projects from the solution and re-add them from their new locations within the `src` and `tests` folders.

4. **Commit the Changes**: After updating the solution, use Git to commit the changes to the folder structure and the updated `.sln` file.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Organize projects into physical src and tests folders"
git push origin main
```

When you push the changes, the new folder structure will be reflected in your remote Git repository.

This approach is a good practice for maintaining an organized and navigable project structure, both within the IDE and in the file system, which can be beneficial for you and any collaborators working on your project.
