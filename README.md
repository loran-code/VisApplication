# VisApplication - Visa Application Website for Peaks of the Balkans

Welcome to VisApplication, an open-source project aimed at simplifying the visa application process for adventurers eager to explore the Peaks of the Balkans. This project is not only a tool to serve the hiking community but also a learning journey into the world of software architecture, specifically Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Clean Architecture (CA), and leveraging the capabilities of GPT and C#/.NET.

## Project Objectives
- To provide a seamless interface for users to apply for hiking visas.
- To explore and implement DDD and CA in a real-world application.
- To document the learning process and decisions in a public forum.

## Architecture Overview
The project is structured around Clean Architecture principles, ensuring our domain logic is at the core of the application's design. This approach allows us to create a system that is flexible, testable, and aligned with business goals.
